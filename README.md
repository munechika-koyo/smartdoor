Smartdoor system including NFC card detecting, key locking/unlocking, turning LED on/off, etc. with Raspberry Pi.

## Default circuit diagram
The default circuit diagram is shown below. If you want to use other GPIO pin numbers, please edit the configuration file (see below).

## Quick Installation
```bash
sudo python -m pip install smartdoor
```

## Before getting started

### `smartdoor_host` system
Smartdoor Host system which serves the web application for NFC key management must be run. Please
install and deploy it in adavnce. ([see here](https://github.com/munechika-koyo/smartdoor_host)).

### pigpio library
`pigpio` library enables hardware control for PWM signals. This is the optional library for `smartdoor` package. If you want to use it, please install it in advance ([see here](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/download.html)) and run the daemon by the following command:
```bash
sudo pigpiod
```
It is recommended to run the daemon automatically at the system startup. If `pigpio` is installed
and impotable from Python, `smartdoor` package will automatically register it in `systemd` service (see below).

### NFC reader permission
To access NFC reader, the permission of the device file must be set. Please execute the following.
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ACTION==\"add\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"06c3\", GROUP=\"plugdev\" >> /etc/udev/rules.d/nfcdev.rules'
sudo udevadm control -R
```
Then, reboot the system.
This instruction is based on the result of `python -m nfc` command. If you use other NFC reader, please change the `idVendor` and `idProduct` according to your device.


## How to use

Almost all the operations are done by the `smartdoor` command. Please see the help message for the
details:
```bash
smartdoor --help
```

### 1. Set up the configuration file
The default configuration file ca be generated by the following command:
```bash
smartdoor config --generate
```
The configuration file is located at `~/.config/smartdoor.toml`. Please edit it according to your environment.

### 2. Run the main program for testing
The main program can be executed by the following command:
```bash
smartdoor start
```
If you want to specify door is locked/unlocked, add `--locked`/`--unlocked` option, by default
the door is locked.

The main program will be run in the foreground. If you want stop the program, press `Ctrl+C`.

### 3. Set up the auto start
The main program can be automatically run by `systemd` service. To register the `smartdoor.service`
to `systemd`, execute the following command:
```bash
smartdoor service --register
```
Then, the service will be ready for start. Simaltenously, the `pigpiod` service will be registered
if `pigpio` library is installed.

To manually start it, execute the following command:
```bash
smartdoor service --start
```

Please see the help message for other options:
```bash
smartdoor service --help
```
